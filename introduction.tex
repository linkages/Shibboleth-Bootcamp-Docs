Goals
●

What you should know by the end
–
–

How to install SP software

–
●

General understanding about Shibboleth
How to configure SP software

What you should have done by the end
–

Installed your SP

–

Learned how to protect your content

Requirements
●

You should have the following ready for
this class:
–

A test/dev machine at your office

–

Access to your test/dev machine

–

Capability to install software on test/dev
machine

–

Willingness to have your test/dev machine
go down for a bit

Definitions
●

Shibboleth Service Provider ( SP )
–

●

That's you. Its the application that you run
on your webserver

Shibboleth Identity Provider ( IdP )
–

The central authentication server. This is
what authenticates the user and vends
attributes about the user

Definitions (continued)
●

Security Assertion Markup Language
(SAML)
–

●

Service Endpoint
–

●

An XML standard for exchanging
authentication and authorization data
A set of URLs on the SP and IdP that are
used to transfer SAML documents

Metadata
–

A document that names all the Service
Endpoints

Definitions ( continued )
●

Entity Identifier ( entityID )
–

A universal resource name ( urn ) that
identifies your SP

–

All entityID's for UF take the following form:
●
●
●

urn:edu:ufl:prod:XXXXX for production
urn:edu:ufl:test:XXXXX for test
urn:edu:ufl:dev:XXXXX for dev

Shibboleth software on your SP
●

The Shibboleth software that runs on your
SP is setup as follows:
–

Shibboleth module that runs in your
webserver ( IIS/Apache ) that maps URIs
to shibboleth requests
●

–

Talks to Shibboleth daemon

Shibboleth daemon that does all the heavy
lifting
●
●

Decrypts SAML
Extracts attributes

Software Install
●

Official directions are here:
–

●

http://www.it.ufl.edu/identity/shibboleth/technical.html

The directions are similar between
Windows/IIS and Unix/Apache

Install the software - Windows
●

●

●

●

http://www.it.ufl.edu/identity/shibboleth/technicalIIS.html

Download the latest MSI installer from this
page for your platform and install it
followed be a reboot
Please do not change any defaults offered
by the installer unless absolutely
necessary
Verify that the installer setup the ISAPI filter
and setup the Shibboleth daemon

Install the software – RHEL
●

●

●

●

http://www.it.ufl.edu/identity/shibboleth/technicalapache.html

Download and install the RPMs from this
page for your platform
Edit Apache config to load the shibboleth
module and set UseCanonicalName
Restart Apache and start the Shibboleth
daemon

Configuring Shibboleth Daemon
●

●

All configuration for shibboleth daemon is
in the shibboleth2.xml file
Get the template shibboleth2.xml file from
the open-systems website:
–

●

http://open-systems.ufl.edu/shibboleth

Place the file in the correct location:
–

Windows – C:\opt\shibbolethsp\etc\shibboleth/shibboleth2.xml

–

Unix - /etc/shibboleth/shibboleth2.xml

Configuring Shibboleth Daemon –
Update shibboleth2.xml template
●

Replace variables in the shibboleth2.xml
file
–

–

●

_HOSTNAME_ : fully qualified domain of
your site
_URN_ : entityID assigned to you by
Bridges IAM Admin

For Windows you also have
–

_SITEID_ : IIS “Site Identifier” for this
website

Configuring Shibboleth Daemon –
Generate key and certificate
●

Remove the sp-cert.pem and sp-key.pem
from the Shibboleth configuration
directory for your platform
–

Windows – c:\opt\shibbolethsp\etc\shibboleth

–

Unix - /etc/shibboleth

Configure Shibboleth Daemon –
Generate key and certificate
●

Generate the key and certificate
–

Windows - keygen.bat -h _HOSTNAME_ -e _URN_

–

Unix - keygen.sh -h _HOSTNAME_ -e _URN_

Configure Shibboleth DaemonGenerate key and certificate
●

Rename the generated files
–

–

●

sp-cert.pem should be renamed to
_HOSTNAME_.cert
sp-key.pem should be renamed to
_HOSTNAME_.key

Restart the shibboleth daemon

Check your install
●

If all went well, then you should have a
shibboleth daemon running and the
webserver should respond with your
SP's metadata at this URL
–

http://_HOSTNAME_/Shibboleth.sso/Metadata

Check your install – Review your
metadata
●
●

●

Take a look at your metadata
Make sure the entityID is correct for this
SP
Make sure there is at least one of the
following services defined
–

AssertionConsumerService

–

ManageNameIDService

–

SingleLogoutService

Congratulations!
●
●

●

Your SP is now configured
Submit your Metadata for inclusion in the
IdP using https://opensystems.ufl.edu/shibmeta
Until this happens your will get an error
message on your SP:
–

Error Message: SAML 2 SSO profile is not
configured for relying party
urn:edu:ufl:XXXX:YYYYY

Protecting Content
●

Two ways to accomplish content
protection
–

Modify shibboleth2.xml

–

Modify .htaccess ( can only be done on
Apache )

Protecting Content
( shibboleth2.xml )
●
●

●

●

●

This can be used for both IIS and Apache
This is the only way to protect content in
IIS
Add a <Path> element to the <Host>
element
Add a <AccessControl> element to <Path>
element
Add a <Rule> element to the
<AccessControl> element

Protecting Content
( shibboleth2.xml)
Simple example
<RequestMapper>
<RequestMap>
<Host name=”example.com”>
<Path name=”secure” requireSession=”true” authType=”shibboleth”>
<AccessControl>
<Rule require=”primary-affiliation” >S</Rule>
</AccessControl>
</Path>
</Host>
</RequestMap>
</RequestMapper>

Protecting Content
( shibboleth2.xml)
Complex example
<RequestMapper>
<RequestMap>
<Host name=”example.com” requireSession=”true” authType=”shibboleth”>
<Path name=”secure”>
<AccessControl>
<OR>
<Rule require=”primary-affiliation” >S</Rule>
<Rule require=”primary-affiliation”>F</Rule>
</OR>
</AccessControl>
</Path>
</Host>
</RequestMap>
</RequestMapper>

Protecting Content ( .htaccess )
●

Much easier to use and maintain

●

If you are using Apache, use this method

Protecting Content ( .htaccess )
Simple Example
AuthType Shibboleth
ShibRequireSession On
Require valid-user

Protecting Content ( .htaccess )
Complex Example
AuthType Shibboleth
ShibRequireSession On
Require primary-affliation ~ S|F
